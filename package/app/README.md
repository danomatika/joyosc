Source of the application icon (see png folder): https://www.flaticon.com/

**Installation:** Copy the joyosc folder to your Applications (Mac) or Program Files (Windows) folder.

Launch joyosc either with the included Joyosc application icon, or by running `joyosc -w` from the command line. Close the little joyosc window to exit the program.

Sample configuration file and Pd patches can be found in the doc folder.

**Note:** The command used to invoke joyosc with the application icon can be edited if you need to change the options.

On Windows, right-click the joyosc application icon and change the command in the Target field.
