/// DeviceManager device list may not == the joystick's SDL index.
/// In this case we open the device using the SDL index but set the name
/// and the index using the device list id.
///
/// This way, if there are two joysticks plugged in, js0 & js1, and js0 is
/// unplugged then replugged, js0 will be given index 0 even though it's SDL
/// index is actually 1 since it's now the second joystick as far as SDL is
